I've tossed around the idea of pursuing web development for a while after some dabbling in coding.. After completing some side projects at my current job and working on some free tutorials, my passion for coding was ignited, and I decided to **jump**!  

My current goal is to complete the course in under 6 months. I am still currently working a full-time job so my start has been slow, but I am ramping up soon. I am determined to be a **success story** in this transition from field to field. I aim to look back at this first blog post and think, "I did it!"  

I also want this post to be a reminder about why I chose this path. My core motivations are as follows.   

1. **I love the web.** It entered my life as a wee elementary school student, and it has never ceased to play a constant role in my life. It opened up my mind to so much information and so many thoughts and ideas. It helped shape me into the person that I am today. I don't see it going anywhere, and the emerging technologies excite me.   
 
2. I have reached a **stagnant period** in my current career. I find my old passions for my current field to be dwindling, and I refuse to remain idle. I am taking responsibility for my own career path and pursuing a **new passion**.   
 
3. I love **problem solving**. This has been a core part of my current job since it constantly demanded me to "figure it out." The start-up nature of my job has waned so it is time to find it elsewhere.  
 
I am so glad that I typed this out because it is already motivating me! Well, time to stop typing away here and get to it. The work isn't going to do itself!  

P.S. Mike, if you are reading this in 6 months or less and you are struggling, read the three points above and think about it for a few moments.   

P.P.S. If you are reading this in 6 months or less and you have completed the course, shout out "I did it!" (but not too loud, you will scare your dog).
