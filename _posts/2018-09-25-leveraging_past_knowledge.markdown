I'm focusing this blog post on reflecting on the knowledge that I've gained from the Full Stack Web Development program thus far and how it connects to what I've learned prior.

Before Flatiron, I completed a CS edX course. It was a great introduction and refresher on many concepts relating to programming and web development. Two big takeaways were abstraction and writing pseudocode. So far in the Intro to Ruby section of the Full Stack program, pseudocode and abstraction have played a large role as well. The Intro to Ruby section has shown me step by step not only how to solve problems but also to design great code by reducing complexity and increasing efficiency. This section was also great in prompting a lot of assignments with pseudocode. Seeing so many examples of pseudocode has improved my ability to break down problems into smaller, more tackleable parts that can be united together. Paired with test driven methods, I see the great power of planning when applied to writing code.

I also spent some time with another popular online bootcamp. I ultimately decided on Flatiron due to the great support and online community. In the other bootcamp, I made a lot of progress in JavaScript (which I am eager to do in Flatiron as well). One concept from the other course that really helped me with the Intro to Ruby section of Flatiron was nested data structures. Long ago, I only associated the word "array" with complex Excel formulas that I grabbed from Stack Overflow. Now, I can see the power of using arrays to nest data and iterate in Ruby and JavaScript.

Overall, my previous experiences with web development have helped me navigate some of the concepts in this course, but I feel much more productive in smaller amounts of time by watching the videos, completing the coding assignments, and reading through the material on Learn.co. I am excited to learn more technologies over the coming months!

P.S. My biggest development is focusing 100% on Flatiron starting on October 2nd. This will be a huge achievement for me since I want to focus all of my efforts on this course. I am also eager to start a new weekly routine that will allow me to start running and practicing yoga again. May I make strides before the next post!
